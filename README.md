# Code Quiz
In this application, I have made a quiz of coding-related questions for the user to answer.
Upon starting the quiz, the user is presented with a randomly-selected question to answer, and a timer begins to tick down.
Every time the user answers incorrectly, the background color will indicate red. When the user answers correctly, the background color changes to green.
